# Ortho Square Sound Visualizer

This sketch consists of a 3D array of boxes that is syncronized with the audio of Four tet - Planet.

The audio amplitude is being mapped into the boxes' heigth and the left and right channel frequencies are being mapped to reshape the width and depth of the boxes.

My first attempt at shape manipulation through audio input.
