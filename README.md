# Ortho Square Sound Visualizer

This sketch consists of a 3D array of boxes that is syncronized with the audio of Four tet - Planet.

The audio amplitude is re-drawing each of the boxes every frame and the left and right channel frequencies are being mapped to reshape the x and z axes of the boxes.

My first attempt at shape manipulation through audio input.
